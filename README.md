# Red Hat Summit 2018: 
# Getting Hands On With Istio on OpenShift

![Istio Logo](instructions/images/istio-logo.png)

## Purpose

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of
and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the burden
of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed on the
application developer, with different or non-existent support for microservice
concepts depending on language and framework.

The service mesh concept pushes this responsibility to the infrastructure, with
features for traffic management, distributed tracing and observability, policy
enforcement, and service/identity security, freeing the developer to focus on
business value. In this hands-on session you will learn how to apply some of
these features to a simple polyglot microservices application running on top of
OpenShift using Istio, an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices.

## Background

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio
provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load
balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without
requiring any changes in application code. OpenShift can automatically inject a
special sidecar proxy throughout your environment to enable Istio management for
your application. This proxy intercepts all network communication between your
microservices microservices, and is configured and managed using Istioâ€™s control
plane functionality -- not your application code!

### Fetch connect script

First, open a terminal and run the following commands:

~~~bash
cd
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesfalkner/istio-lab-summit-2018/master/scripts/connect.sh
~~~

### Find your hostname

In the browser, you had requested a lab environment. On that page, you were
assigned a GUID (a 4-digit alphanumeric string). For example, `xxxx`.

### Execute connect script

To connect to your provisioned lab machine, run the following command:

**MAKE SURE THAT YOU SUBSTITUTE `xxxx` FOR THE GUID THAT YOU WERE ASSIGNED**

~~~bash
cd
bash connect.sh openshift-xxxx.rhpds.opentlc.com
~~~

Make sure you type _yes_ to complete the SSH connection.

Once connected, your lab machine has several environment variables pre-defined,
and has Istio added to your `$PATH`. You can confirm this is set correctly:

~~~bash
echo Istio Home: $ISTIO_HOME && \
echo Istio Lab Content: $ISTIO_LAB_HOME && \
echo Istio Lab Project Name: $ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT && \
echo Path: $PATH
~~~

### Start OpenShift and install Istio
All of the exercises in this lab will be performed as the `root` system user.
First, escalate your privileges using the following `sudo` command: 

**MAKE SURE THAT YOU EXECUTE THE SUDO COMMAND EXACTLY OR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES WILL NOT PROPAGATE CORRECTLY**

~~~bash
sudo -E -i
~~~

Then, execute the following two commands which will start the local OpenShift
environment and install Istio into it:

~~~bash
cd $ISTIO_LAB_HOME
./scripts/start.sh
~~~

The start script will then output a URL for you to visit:

~~~
--------------------
Setup complete. Open the Lab Instructions in your browser: http://istio-workshop-guides.aa.bb.cc.dd.xip.io
--------------------
~~~

This is the URL for your customized lab guide that you will use for the rest of
the lab. Please open that URL in your browser and continue from there.

# Using this lab content elsewhere
## Deploy On OpenShift

You can deploy the lab guides as a container image anywhere but most
conveniently, you can deploy it on OpenShift Online or other OpenShift flavours:

```
oc new-project guides
oc new-app osevg/workshopper --name=istio-workshop \
      -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesfalkner/istio-lab-summit-2018/master/instructions
      -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesfalkner/istio-lab-summit-2018/master/instructions/_rhsummit19.yml" \
      -e JAVA_APP=false \
      -e OPENSHIFT_MASTER="http://127.0.0.1:8443" \
      -e APPS_SUFFIX="apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io" \
      -e ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME="127.0.0.1"

oc expose svc/istio-workshop
```

Replace `OPENSHIFT_MASTER` with the URL to the console of your working OpenShift
environment (e.g.  `http://128.0.0.1:8443`), `APPS_SUFFIX` with your default
routing suffix (e.g.  `apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io`), and `ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME` with
the public hostname of your machine. These variables are used to subsitute
values in the markdown content files.

The guides can then be accessed at `http://istio-workshop-guides.$APPS_SUFFIX`.

The lab content (`.md` files) will be pulled from the GitHub when users access the guides in
their browser.

Note that the workshop variables can be overriden via specifying environment
variables on the container itself e.g. the `JAVA_APP` env var in the above
command

## Test Locally with Docker

You can directly run Workshopper as a docker container which is specially helpful when writing the content.
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/app-data \
              -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX="file:///app-data/instructions" \
              -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="file:///app-data/instructions/_rhsummit19.yml" \
              -e OPENSHIFT_MASTER="foo" \
              -e APPS_SUFFIX="$MY_IP.xip.io" \
              -e ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME="MY_HOSTNAME" \
              osevg/workshopper:latest
```

Replace `OPENSHIFT_MASTER` with the URL to the console of your working OpenShift
environment (e.g.  `http://128.0.0.1:8443`), `APPS_SUFFIX` with your default
routing suffix (e.g.  `apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io`), and `ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME` with
the public hostname of your machine. These variables are used to subsitute
values in the markdown content files.

Go to `http://localhost:8080` on your browser to see the rendered workshop
content. You can modify the lab instructions and refresh the page to see the
latest changes.
